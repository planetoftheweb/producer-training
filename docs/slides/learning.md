Methods and principles used in adult education<!-- .element:  class="text-white" -->

> > Author Notes: A well researched framework for thinking about the motivations behind how adults learn. Codified by Malcolm Knowles in the 1970's, but developed over decades of research and studying psychology. The principles should seem obvious and are validated by some of the research that we've been doing.

# Six Principles

1. **Need to know** - <small>Learners want to know why they need to learn something</small>
2. **Self-concept** - <small>Learners like to feel like they're in charge</small>
3. **Prior Experience** - <small>Learners have a wide range of experience levels</small>
4. **Readiness** - <small>Learners want training when they need to know something</small>
5. **Orientation** - <small>Learners are encouraged by solutions to real problems</small>
6. **Motivation** - <small>Learners are better motivated by internal pressures</small>

# Need to know

Learners need to know why they need to learn something.

> > Author Notes:

It's going to take considerable energy. We should clearly identify this in the introduction movie, but in order to maintain engagement, we should make sure that every chapter and video answers this as well. The goal is to make the learner aware of the need to know. Answer the following: Why, What, How

Scenarios go a long way for this; starting courses out with a story. This is also accomplished through the Why, connecting individual actions to the broader real world tasks being taught.

# Self-concept

Learners like to feel like they are<br>in charge of their own decisions

> > Author Notes:

They resent and resist situations in which they feel others are imposing their wills on them. The way we organize our content into videos, allows them to skip certain videos. We can fulfill this need by creating courses that can be taken out of sequence. Each video should be focused on solving different, but related needs. Cookbook type courses would offer users a way to direct their own learning based on their needs.

---

# Prior Experience

Learning groups have diverse experience<br>and learning styles

> > Author Notes:

We can't assume that everyone wants the same experience. Some people will appreciate social learning through features like study groups, assessment and activities, when they make sense. Also, we shouldn't try to have a one-size fits all structure to all courses, but examine when a Problem/Solution course makes sense, and when a Study Group makes sense. Whereas an assessment on a course, might make great sense for exam prep, maybe not so much for a project-based course.

# Readiness to Learn

Learners's desire to learn depends on<br>where they are in their journey.

> > Author Notes:

It's important to cover some topics not only in depth, but providing progressive relationships between courses (learn this first, then take this, etc.)

The fact that LiL is seen as lacking advanced content could be happening because we're not solving problems that Advanced Users have, so it might be good to come up with courses that speak to those users.

This rule also speaks to the fact that there could be a more of a progression or a structure to how courses are related to each other. Author's often work in a vacuum and don't know what a progression for learning a framework should be.

---

# Orientation to Learning

Learners want a task or<br>problem centered approach to learning.

> > Author Notes:

They learn new knowledge when lessons are placed in the context of Real Life Applications.

So, an example of programmatic recursion, or event bubbling is more relevant to orientation if you show it in the context of solving a [real world problem](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/mastering-web-developer-interview-code/what-are-event-bubbling-and-propagation-about?u=2125562)

This could also play to how we organize content, so that instead of creating a part 1, 2 and 3 course, you organize each part around solving problems (instead of Composition 1, 'Writing business letters')

A course titled “Composition I” in the day program became “Writing Better Business Letters” in the evening program; “Composition II” became “Writing for Pleasure and Profit”; and “Composition III” became “Improving Your Professional Communications.”

Asking authors “what real tasks should learners be able to accomplish?” not just at video description level but at the level of the entire course.

# Motivation to Learn

Learners respond better to internal motivators

> > Author Notes:

Learners are responsive to external motivators (better jobs, promotions, higher salaries) but the most powerful motivation are internal pressures (job satisfaction, self-esteem, quality of life). We should incorporate some of this motivation into our training. Although someone could be motivated to take a course to pass a certification exam, perhaps a course on the best plug-ins to make your life easier in VSCode. We need to think about the payoff for taking a course.
